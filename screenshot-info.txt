<!-- Theme Screenshot Placeholder -->
<!-- This would normally be a 1200x900 PNG file named screenshot.png -->
<!-- For now, we'll create an HTML file that explains what the screenshot should show -->

Theme Screenshot Guidelines:
- Size: 1200px Ã— 900px
- Format: PNG
- Filename: screenshot.png

The screenshot should show:
1. The mystical hero section with purple gradients
2. Star effects and celestial motifs  
3. The elegant typography (Cormorant Garamond/Playfair)
4. Celebrity predictions section
5. The rose gold and purple color scheme
6. The overall magical, premium aesthetic

This file should be replaced with an actual screenshot.png image once the theme is live and styled.
